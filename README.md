# AngularSandbox

An Angular playground for exploring different Angular ideas.

Built using the free [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co), it is deployed
[here on GitHub Pages](https://poslek.com/angular-sandbox/) where you can try it
out.

## Installing

Run `npm install`.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The
app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in
the `dist/` directory. Use the `npm run build:prod` script for a production
build. Use the `npm run build:prodGithub` to build it for GitHub Pages.

## Pre-commit hooks

A set of scripts will run before each commit. You can test those hooks by
running `npm run pre-commit`.
