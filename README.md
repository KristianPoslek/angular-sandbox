# AngularSandbox

An Angular playground for exploring different Angular ideas.

Built using the free [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co), it is deployed
[here on GitHub Pages](https://poslek.com/angular-sandbox/) where you can try it
out.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app
will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the
`dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. Use the
`--base-href /angular-sandbox/` to build it for GitHub Pages.
